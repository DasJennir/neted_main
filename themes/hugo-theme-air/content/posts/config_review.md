Security Assessments is something very frequent for a system administrator to be part of or even execute. New breaches and vulnerabilities are found every day, being the need for these system reviews be so frequent.

Configuration review is the low level audiation of a system components with the point of finding out hidden vulnerabilities that are hardly seem, but that experienced hacker frequently have a look into because low level vulnerabilities are hardly found for being hard, expansive and exhaustive to be executed in a company environment. Some examples of infrastructure that takes part of this review are switches , storage servers, firewalls, and also OSs configurations such as Windows, Linux, and OS X.

Thankfully we have organizations which takes care of doing and preparing documentations which sites the most important key that you have to look into while doing the examination such as:

- NIST's"National Checklist Program Repository" [Website](https://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/repository)
- NSA's "IA Guidance" [Website](https://www.nsa.gov/what-we-do/cybersecurity/)
- DISA's "Security Technical Implementation Guides [Website](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/)

By following some of these guides mentioned above, you will filter some of the most common errors and ensure for the most part that the place in which the assessment has been made is much more secure and protected.
