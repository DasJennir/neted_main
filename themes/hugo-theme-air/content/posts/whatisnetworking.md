#### What is computing networking ? in fact that is a very complex question to be answered if we consider ever aspect of it, but we can sum it up with the following:

**_Explanation:_**

A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes (computer, laptops, servers, celphones, printers...) which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.

Data tranmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pait or fibre-optic cables (layer 1), or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, microwave transmission, or free-space optical communication.

**_Abstraction:_**

What we can take from it is, that the point of a computing networking is to share resources among nodes, digitaly. If we abStract that, it is as if whenever I send a email to you, I am tecnicaly writing on a piece of paper the menssage that I wanted you to receive. the whole point of the network is to trasform pyshical data into digital therefore facilitation the transport and receive of it if applied in the right way.

**_Simples Network Possible:_**

So try to imagine the simples network possible how would it be ? Have you think of one ? well let's take this in consideration first, the point of a computer network is to share and transport data to other nodes, in real life it would be I willing to share something to a person, it doesn't matter the subject or the action as long as a person receives what I want it to hear or see, in computing that would be two nodes (computer, cellphone, laptop, etc) connected together and sharing information between each other. So two computers connected dirrectely to one another wirelessly or wired would already be a network !

**_Biggest Network Possible_**

What is the biggest network that you can imagine of ? if you said the internet you were correct !!! The internet is the biggest that we can imagine and possible have because it is litteraly the sum up of ALL nodes connect together through all ISPs (Internet Service Providers) in the whole world, sharing information amoung each other. Your router is your menssager and the ISPs are all the bridgets connecting every "continent" to one another, imagine how huge this is !!!
