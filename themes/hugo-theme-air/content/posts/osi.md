The OSI model is a table which network engenieers have created to facilitate the interpretation of the various computer networking "steps" that takes places though the whole process of sending data to a node to another. Abstracting it in a way that makes more sense to people which are not used to this subject or students that are startining to learn about it.

**_Short History, How the model was created:_**

In the early- and mid-1970s, networking was largely either government-sponsored or vendor-developed with proprietary standards, such as IBM's. The Experimental Packet Switched System in the UK circa 1973-5 identified the need for defining higher level protocols.

The UK National Computing Centre publication 'Why Distributed Computing' which came from considerable research into future configurations for computer systems,resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977.

In 1983, the ISO documents were merged to form The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnectionusually referred to as the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model, OSI Reference Model, or simply OSI model. It was published in 1984 by both the ISO, and CCITT therefore oficially creating the model once for all.

I will be posting a topic for each specific layer on this website, explaining their purpose, devices and the types of data unit used.
