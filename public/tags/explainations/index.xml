      <description>What is computing networking ? in fact that is a very complex question to be answered if we consider ever aspect of it, but we can sum it up with the following: Explanation:
A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes (computer, laptops, servers, celphones, printers&amp;hellip;) which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.
Data tranmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pait or fibre-optic cables (layer 1), or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, microwave transmission, or free-space optical communication.</description>
