<h4 id="what-is-computing-networking--in-fact-that-is-a-very-complex-question-to-be-answered-if-we-consider-ever-aspect-of-it-but-we-can-sum-it-up-with-the-following">What is computing networking ? in fact that is a very complex question to be answered if we consider ever aspect of it, but we can sum it up with the following:</h4>
<p><strong><em>Explanation:</em></strong></p>
<p>A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes (computer, laptops, servers, celphones, printers&hellip;) which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.</p>
<p>Data tranmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pait or fibre-optic cables (layer 1), or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, microwave transmission, or free-space optical communication.</p>
<p><strong><em>Abstraction:</em></strong></p>
<p>What we can take from it is, that the point of a computing networking is to share resources among nodes, digitaly. If we abStract that, it is as if whenever I send a email to you, I am tecnicaly writing on a piece of paper the menssage that I wanted you to receive. the whole point of the network is to trasform pyshical data into digital therefore facilitation the transport and receive of it if applied in the right way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Simples Network Possible:</em></strong></p>
<p>So try to imagine the simples network possible how would it be ? Have you think of one ? well let&rsquo;s take this in consideration first, the point of a computer network is to share and transport data to other nodes, in real life it would be I willing to share something to a person, it doesn&rsquo;t matter the subject or the action as long as a person receives what I want it to hear or see, in computing that would be two nodes (computer, cellphone, laptop, etc) connected together and sharing information between each other. So two computers connected dirrectely to one another wirelessly or wired would already be a network !</p>
<p><strong><em>Biggest Network Possible</em></strong></p>
<p>What is the biggest network that you can imagine of ? if you said the internet you were correct !!! The internet is the biggest that we can imagine and possible have because it is litteraly the sum up of ALL nodes connect together through all ISPs (Internet Service Providers) in the whole world, sharing information amoung each other. Your router is your menssager and the ISPs are all the bridgets connecting every &ldquo;continent&rdquo; to one another, imagine how huge this is !!!</p>

          <section class="post-content">
            <p>The OSI model is a table which network engenieers have created to facilitate the interpretation of the various computer networking &ldquo;steps&rdquo; that takes places though the whole process of sending data to a node to another. Abstracting it in a way that makes more sense to people which are not used to this subject or students that are startining to learn about it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Short History, How the model was created:</em></strong></p>
<p>In the early- and mid-1970s, networking was largely either government-sponsored or vendor-developed with proprietary standards, such as IBM&rsquo;s. The Experimental Packet Switched System in the UK circa 1973-5 identified the need for defining higher level protocols.</p>
<p>The UK National Computing Centre publication &lsquo;Why Distributed Computing&rsquo; which came from considerable research into future configurations for computer systems,resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977.</p>
<p>In 1983, the ISO documents were merged to form The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnectionusually referred to as the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model, OSI Reference Model, or simply OSI model. It was published in 1984 by both the ISO, and CCITT therefore oficially creating the model once for all.</p>

<p>I will be posting a topic for each specific layer on this website, explaining their purpose, devices and the types of data unit used.</p>

          <section class="post-content">
            <p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiber-optical-networking.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2Ffiber-optic-cable-installation.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1" alt="Layer one Optic Cable"></p>
<p>The OSI model has been already explained on this website if you are not sure what this is I highly suggest you to have a look there before you start reading this article.</p>
<p>Layer 1 :</p>
<p>The physical layer is the first and lowest layer of the OSI model. It represents the hardware involved during the tranports of bits (data) though a computing network. Examples of devices from the first layer are copper cables, hubs, and NICs (network interface card). We interpret thoso devices as the first layer because they are resposible to carry the actual &ldquo;pysical data&rdquo; which is the eletrecity voltage (ethernet cable), light (fiber optic cable), radio frequency (wi-fi/wireless).</p>
<p><strong><em>What about the other hardwares</em></strong></p>
<p>So why aren&rsquo;t routers and switches part of the first layer ? Good question ! the reason why rubs, cables and NICs are and the others aren&rsquo;t is because they don&rsquo;t need to do any kind of calculation or &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; their only task is to forward the data to the next device until they reach the desired destination !!!</p>
<p>So if you take this in consideration this is one of the easiest layers to interpret and understand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Functionality of each device</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Ethernet Hubs:</em></strong></p>
<p>The purpose of the hub is to expand a network, we could compare that to a switch but they have a fair difference among each other for a comparison to be possible. First of all hubs forward all data that they recive to all ethernet cables connected to it, hubs don&rsquo;t know what device send the data from. So imagine five ethernet cables connected together forwarding data to each other all the time without knowing which port to send to, it causes a lot of performance issues to the network as a whole. You are problay saying to yourself &lsquo;wow hubs are really usuless what is the point to have one ?', well hubs are cheap and can be easlly upgraded by just pluging the internet cable on it, without the need of setting up anything at all, so you have to imagine yourself as a home user, you want practicy,so if you want to have more ethernet ports for your router for a lower cost at home, it is ok if you lose a little bit of performance as long as you get things done ! Well&hellip; maybe in the early 20s, nowadays with the advance of technology hubs are losing their purpose because there are switches in the market which get the job done for the same price of a hub, you may find a purpose for one of them but the more their time passes by the least amount of hubs you will find.</p>
<p><strong><em>Copper cables:</em></strong></p>
<p>The most well known copper cables used in computing network is the RJ-45, they are responsible to tranport the eletricy that will represent the bits (0 and 1) when they reach their destination. The rj-45 has a lot of categories nowadays popular known as CATs (Cat5/Cat5e/Cat6/Cat7/Cat8) the main point to know about is that the numbers essentially represents an improvement over its predecessor, which means Cat 8 carries much more data than Cat 5. Copper cables are good for short distances but what if we want to carry data let&rsquo;s say from one building to another ? that is when fiber optic cobles comes in.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fiber optic cables:</em></strong></p>
<p>This kind of cables have a different purpose, it is able to provide higher bandwidth and transmit data over longer distances than copper cables but at a higher cost, these are the ones responsible to tranmit data over the continents (with the help of repeaters of course). There are two kinds of fiber optics available, the Multimode and Singlemode. Singlemode is used to transmit data over longer distances without the cost of lossing bandwidth but with the cost of only being able to care one signal at a time, and Multimode is able to carry multiples signals at the same time with the cost of not transporting data over such long distances as Singlemode does.</p>
<p><strong><em>Data Unit:</em></strong></p>
<p>The data unit name that we use to represent the data send are the Bits which is the lowest level that we can interpret and represent of data that we can possibly send. Bits are 1 and 0 they simply represent on and off or as some people prefer to say yes and no 1=ON/YES and 0=OFF/NO bits is a very complex subject if we take in consideration how we tranform these two number into images, movies, video games, etc. In the future I will be creating a topic only discusting bits and how we can possible make so many things out of these two numbers.</p>
<p><strong><em><em>Resources:</em></em></strong></p>
