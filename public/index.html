          <section class="post-content">
            <p><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,g_auto,h_1248,w_2220/f_auto,q_auto,w_1100/v1555347594/shape/mentalfloss/e_27.png" alt="OSI Layer 2"></p>
<p>The OSI model has been already explained on this website if you are not sure what this is I highly suggest you to have a look there before you start reading this article.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2:</strong></p>
<p>Data link layer (layer 2 from the osi model) is responsible for the transport of frames between nodes (computer, laptops, servers, etc) between a network segment among the physical layer. Any errors and corruptions during the process of frames is corrected and fixed by this layer protocols therefore providing integrity and confidentiality.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity Check:</strong></p>
<p>The PDU (Protocol Data Units) of this layer is the frame. Frame Synchronization (FM) is one of the features which gives the integrity of the frames received which consists of a sequence of bits symbols that indicate to the receiver node the beginning and the end of the payload frames (email, website frontend, file received via ftp etc). With FM also comes FCS (Frame Check Sequence) that is an error-detecting code added to the frame its only purpose is for error detection not recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware:</strong></p>
<p>Switches and bridges, WAP (wireless access points) are just some examples of the hardware that this layer consist of, they play a big role during the process of transportation ensuring that frames are being transmitted correctly without any corruption.</p>
<p><strong>Switches:</strong></p>
<p>Switches are devices that takes care of multiples frames being transmitted at the same time to different nodes separating and filtering each frame received individually to avoid collisions (they use the ASIC chips to make these decisions),increasing stability and reliability of a network segment, they are a better version of a Hubs which did not have this &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Bridges:</strong></p>
<p>Bridges are similar to switches with only some minor differences which you can check on the references that I will be listening bellow the post</p>
<p><strong>Wireless Access Point:</strong></p>
<p>Is the device that allows people to access the network using radio frequencies, it somehow acts like a hub because all frames are being transmitted though the same &ldquo;air space&rdquo; but they can be separated though different channel numbers which the government chooses which are allowed to be used or not.</p>

    </header>
    <section class="post-excerpt">
      <p>
          <section class="post-content">
            <p>The TCP/IP model is just like any other computer network model invented and adopted by people to abstract and represent the &ldquo;steps&rdquo; in which the data that we send and receive though a computer network the most known being the internet.</p>
<p>This model was created by IETF RFC 1122, Internet STD 3 (1989) (I will be providing link of the documentation in the end of the article) which was mostly invented for the sake of simplicity. Overtime after the creation of the first model (OSI) network engineer started to see that layer 7,6,5 could all be together in one unique and unified layer that is now represented by the application layer of the TCP/IP model.</p>
<p><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gdZOMP_8Et4/WTkK6gAKRQI/AAAAAAAACzw/XhDjcUcKGhACYw2URSTEqty4Q7hVOs76ACLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-06-08%2Bat%2B1.59.05%2BPM.png" alt="TCP/IP model"></p>
<p>Some models nowadays even adobt only 3 layers like the Arpanet model, but we mostly use the TCP/IP model as refference nowadays. Layers 7,6,5 were not really the biggest concern for us network engineers or enthusiastics, only the first four layers were being mostly used. Remember that the reason why we have a model is to get a complex problem and brake it down into smaller pieces to make it as clear as possible for people to undersatnad. So the adoption of one model over the other is just because people saw it was simplier.</p>
<p>Is one better than the other ? not really, in the end we end up having the same thing the only difference being the amount of names that you have to memorize :p. Imagine it like a networking blueprint each person will specialize in one area like trasport and someone else into data link, in the end the model doesn&rsquo;t matter because the abstraction ends up being the same. Imagine a situation which a software engeenier (layer 7,6,5) would have something related to a network engeeniers (layer 1,2,3,4) and vice versa,the result would be a disaster, the models are just there to abstract what decision each person does in the end of the day !</p>

          <section class="post-content">
            <p><img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fiber-optical-networking.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F10%2Ffiber-optic-cable-installation.jpg&amp;f=1&amp;nofb=1" alt="Layer one Optic Cable"></p>
<p>The OSI model has been already explained on this website if you are not sure what this is I highly suggest you to have a look there before you start reading this article.</p>
<p>Layer 1 :</p>
<p>The physical layer is the first and lowest layer of the OSI model. It represents the hardware involved during the transport of bits (data) though a computing network. Examples of devices from the first layer are copper cables, hubs, and NICs (network interface card). We interpret these devices as the first layer because they are responsible to carry the actual &ldquo;physical data&rdquo; which is the electricity voltage (ethernet cable), light (fiber optic cable), radio frequency (wi-fi/wireless).</p>
<p><strong><em>What about others hardwares</em></strong></p>
<p>So why aren&rsquo;t routers and switches part of the first layer ? Good question ! the reason why rubs, cables and NICs are and the others aren&rsquo;t is because they don&rsquo;t need to do any kind of calculation or &ldquo;thinking&rdquo; their only task is to forward the data to the next device until they reach the desired destination !!!</p>
<p>So if you take this in consideration this is one of the easiest layers to interpret and understand.</p>
<p><strong><em>Functionality of each device</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Ethernet Hubs/Repeaters:</em></strong> (I will be interpreting repeaters and hubs as the same thing in this explanation because their points is pretty much the same)</p>
<p>The purpose of the hub or a repeater is to expand and emplify a network, we could compare that to a switch but they have a fair difference among each other for a comparison to be possible. First of all hubs forward all data that they received to all ethernet cables connected to it, hubs don&rsquo;t know what device send the data from. So imagine five ethernet cables connected together forwarding data to each other all the time without knowing which port to send to, it causes a lot of performance issues to the network as a whole. You are probably saying to yourself &lsquo;wow hubs are really useless what is the point to have one ?', well hubs are cheap and can be easily upgraded by just plugging the internet cable on it, without the need of setting up anything at all, so you have to imagine yourself as a home user, you want practice,so if you want to have more ethernet ports for your router for a lower cost at home, it is ok if you lose a little bit of performance as long as you get things done ! Well&hellip; maybe in the early 20s, nowadays with the advance of technology hubs are losing their purpose because there are switches in the market which get the job done for the same price of a hub, you may find a purpose for one of them but the more their time passes by the least amount of hubs you will find.</p>
<p><strong><em>Copper cables:</em></strong></p>
<p>The most well known copper cables used in computing network is the RJ-45, they are responsible to transport the electricity that will represent the bits (0 and 1) when they reach their destination. The rj-45 has a lot of categories nowadays popular known as CATs (Cat5/Cat5e/Cat6/Cat7/Cat8) the main point to know about is that the numbers essentially represents an improvement over its predecessor, which means Cat 8 carries much more data than Cat 5. Copper cables are good for short distances but what if we want to carry data let&rsquo;s say from one building to another ? that is when fiber optic cables comes in.</p>
<p><strong><em>Fiber optic cables:</em></strong></p>
<p>This kind of cables have a different purpose, it is able to provide higher bandwidth and transmit data over longer distances than copper cables but at a higher cost, these are the ones responsible to transmit data over the continents (with the help of repeaters of course). There are two kinds of fiber optics available, the Multimode and Singlemode. Singlemode is used to transmit data over longer distances without the cost of losing bandwidth but with the cost of only being able to care one signal at a time, and Multimode is able to carry multiples signals at the same time with the cost of not transporting data over such long distances as Singlemode does.</p>
<p><strong><em>Data Unit:</em></strong></p>
<p>The data unit name that we use to represent the data send are the Bits which is the lowest level that we can interpret and represent of data that we can possibly send. Bits are 1 and 0 they simply represent on and off or as some people prefer to say yes and no 1=ON/YES and 0=OFF/NO bits is a very complex subject if we take in consideration how we transform these two number into images, movies, video games, etc. In the future I will be creating a topic only discuss bits and how we can possible make so many things out of these two numbers.</p>
