<h4 id="what-is-computing-networking--in-fact-that-is-a-very-complex-question-to-be-answered-if-we-consider-ever-aspect-of-it-but-we-can-sum-it-up-with-the-following">What is computing networking ? in fact that is a very complex question to be answered if we consider ever aspect of it, but we can sum it up with the following:</h4>
<p><strong><em>Explanation:</em></strong></p>
<p>A computer network is a digital telecommunications network for sharing resources between nodes (computer, laptops, servers, cellphones, printers&hellip;) which are computing devices that use a common telecommunications technology.</p>
<p>Data transmission between nodes is supported over data links consisting of physical cable media, such as twisted pait or fibre-optic cables (layer 1), or by wireless methods, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, microwave transmission, or free-space optical communication.</p>
<p><strong><em>Abstraction:</em></strong></p>
<p>What we can take from it is, that the point of a computing networking is to share resources among nodes, digitally. If we abStract that, it is as if whenever I send a email to you, I am technically writing on a piece of paper the message that I wanted you to receive. the whole point of the network is to transform physically data into digital therefore facilitation the transport and receive of it if applied in the right way.</p>
<p><strong><em>Simples Network Possible:</em></strong></p>
<p>So try to imagine the simples network possible how would it be ? Have you think of one ? well let&rsquo;s take this in consideration first, the point of a computer network is to share and transport data to other nodes, in real life it would be I willing to share something to a person, it doesn&rsquo;t matter the subject or the action as long as a person receives what I want it to hear or see, in computing that would be two nodes (computer, cellphone, laptop, etc) connected together and sharing information between each other. So two computers connected directly to one another wirelessly or wired would already be a network !</p>
<p><strong><em>Biggest Network Possible</em></strong></p>
<p>What is the biggest network that you can imagine of ? if you said the internet you were correct !!! The internet is the biggest that we can imagine and possible have because it is literally the sum up of ALL nodes connect together through all ISPs (Internet Service Providers) in the whole world, sharing information among each other. Your router is your messager and the ISPs are all the bridges connecting every &ldquo;continent&rdquo; to one another, imagine how huge this is !!!</p>

          <section class="post-content">
            <p>The OSI model is a table which network engineers have created to facilitate the interpretation of the various computer networking &ldquo;steps&rdquo; that takes places though the whole process of sending data to a node to another. Abstracting it in a way that makes more sense to people which are not used to this subject or students that are starting to learn about it.</p>
<p><strong><em>Short History, How the model was created:</em></strong></p>
<p>In the early- and mid-1970s, networking was largely either government-sponsored or vendor-developed with proprietary standards, such as IBM&rsquo;s. The Experimental Packet Switched System in the UK circa 1973-5 identified the need for defining higher level protocols.</p>
<p>The UK National Computing Centre publication &lsquo;Why Distributed Computing&rsquo; which came from considerable research into future configurations for computer systems,resulted in the UK presenting the case for an international standards committee to cover this area at the ISO meeting in Sydney in March 1977.</p>
<p>In 1983, the ISO documents were merged to form The Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection usually referred to as the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model, OSI Reference Model, or simply OSI model. It was published in 1984 by both the ISO, and CCITT therefore officially creating the model once for all.</p>
